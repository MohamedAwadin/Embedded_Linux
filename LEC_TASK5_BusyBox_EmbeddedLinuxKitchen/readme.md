# (From Zero to Hero)Running a 64-bit Kernel with U-Boot and BusyBox(as a Init process) on Raspberry Pi 3B+


In this repository, I will demonstrate how to boot a 64-bit kernel using u-boot and busybox. I struggled to find a complete guide to make me able to do that. So I will try to show that in detail with some screen shots. My purpose is to make things easy for everyone else to build their own kernel without hassle. 

I use a USB drive to boot my custom kernel and not an SD card. A USB drive is much easier for you to remove and plug back in again. Luckily, rpi3b+ can boot from a USB drive without any necessary configuration. All you just need to do is to unplug the SD card if it exists.


# Hardware

1. Raspberry pi 3b+
1. USB drive
1. USB to TTL
1. Required packages:
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu u-boot-tools device-tree-compiler gtkterm
  ```

We'll use USB to TTL to see the kernel messages. It will be connected to the pins 14 and 15 in the raspberry pi. The USB drive will hold our custom linux OS.

# Raspberry pi boot process

First, the ROM bootloader starts and loads the second bootloader in the L2 Cache. Then, the second bootloader `bootcode.bin` starts and enables SDRAM and loads `start.elf`. After that, `start.elf` starts and makes a Flattened Device Tree (FDT) using the device tree binary .dtb in the boot folder and applies overlays that're written in `config.txt`. Then, it passes the FDT to `u-boot` and loads `u-boot`. The `u-boot` starts and loads the kernel into RAM, then it passes the same FDT passed by `start.elf` to the kernel and starts the kernel. Finally, the kernel starts, mounts the filesystem, and executes `/sbin/init`.



# Steps
## 1- Prepare your USB drive

Your USB drive should have two partitions. One should be in `FAT` format. Usually, it's called `boot`. This filesystem will hold the kernel files, the bootloaders, device trees, and overlays. Another one can be in ext4 format. This one holds the linux file system. It's usually called `rootfs`. The file system size should be large enough to hold the content in it.

You can partition your USB drive using either the Ubuntu Disks utility or `cfdisk` command. There are plenty of sources out there to show you how to partition your drive.

This is my USB drive partitions.

## 2- Vendor-specific bootloaders and files

There are vendor-specific files that should exist in the `boot` filesystem. These files are:

1. `boocode.bin`: this is the bootloader, which is loaded by the SoC on boot, does some very basic setup, and then loads the `start.elf` file.
1. `start.elf`: its job is to combine overlays with an appropriate base device tree, and then to pass a fully resolved Device Tree to u-boot.
1. `config.txt`: Contains many configuration parameters for setting up the Raspberry Pi. 
1. `fixup.dat`: This is a linker file.

Those files (except for `config.txt`) can be found in the firmware repository of raspberry pi <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot">here</a>. `config.txt` is created and populated manually (this will be discussed later). You can leave it empty for now.

```bash
awadin@Awadin:/media/awadin/boot$ ls
config.txt  start.elf   
fixup.dat   overlays  

```

## 3- Build a Device Tree Binary (DTB)

u-boot expects a flattened device tree (FDT) from the start.elf bootloader. The start.elf bootloader needs a device tree binary.dtb file to turn it into an FDT and pass it to u-boot. At this moment, we don't have one. So, we need to compile a device tree source first.


1. We need to clone the Linux kernel. We have two options. The first option is to clone the Linux repository and start configuring the kernel without any default configuration. This is a lot of work. The second option, which I chose, is to clone the Linux kernel maintained by the Raspberry Pi because it provides a default configuration to start from.

    The kernel repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">here</a>. You can just run 

    `git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux --depth=1`

    `--depth=1` makes sure that we don't get the whole linux repository history which is so big and not useful for our case. We just need the latest tag.

1. We need to have the cross compiler `aarch64-linux-gnu-`
you can install it on ubuntu using this command:

    `sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`

1. Configure the linux kernel using this command:

    `make bcmrpi3_defconfig ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-`

1. Compile the DTBs using this command:

    `make -j12 dtbs ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-`

1. Move the compiled Device Tree Binary file to the boot filesystem. You can find it under 

    `arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm2837-rpi-3-b-plus.dtb`


```bash
awadin@Awadin:/media/awadin/boot$ ls
bcm2837-rpi-3-b-plus.dtb  config.txt  start.elf   
fixup.dat   overlays  

```


## 4- Configure the raspberry pi through `config.txt`

Your `config.txt` should have these lines:

<img src="images/config.png">

- `enable_uart=1` is basically enabling the the uart to be used by `u-boot.bin`

- `kernel=u-boot.bin` gives the kernel name to be loaded which is `u-boot.bin` in our case.


## 5- `u-boot.bin` build

1. clone `u-boot` repository

    `git clone https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot --depth=1`

2. set the rpi3b+ default configuration

    `make rpi_3_b_plus_defconfig ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-`

3. Make further configuration

    `make menuconfig ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-`

    


1. Build `u-boot`

    - Now you can run:

        `make -j12 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-`

    - Move `u-boot-bin` to the boot filesystem
        
```bash
awadin@Awadin:/media/awadin/boot$ ls
bcm2837-rpi-3-b-plus.dtb  config.txt  start.elf   
fixup.dat   overlays  u-boot.bin

```
    

## Communicate with Raspberry Pi via UART
To interact with U-Boot on the Raspberry Pi, use `gtkterm`:
```sh
gtkterm -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -s 115200
```
Make sure your UART cable is properly connected to the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO header.

u-boot is bootloaded !

## 6- Building the kernel

In step 3, we just built the device tree binaries. There are two more steps to build our custom kernel:
    
1. Configure the kernel with this command:

    `make menuconfig ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-`


1. build the kernel with this command:

    `make -j12 Image ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-`

1. Move the Image to the boot filesystem. You can find it under:
   
    `arch/arm64/boot/Image`

Note: for 64bit kernel, there's no option for making a compressed image e.g. zImage

Note: you can setup a trivial tftp server and grap the image from the host machine.

## 7- Booting the kernel and the `bootargs`


For u-boot to be able to boot the kernel, it should have the kernel and the device tree binary address. The kernel expects some boot arguments. Boot arguments configure things in the kernel. For u-boot to be able to pass the boot arguments, we need to put them in an environment variable `bootargs` using the command `setenv`.


Now let's consider booting the kernel step by step:


1. Turn your raspberry pi on and let u-boot start, then interrupt the autoboot by pressing any key.
2. You should load the kernel into the RAM. You can run this command in u-boot:


    `fatload usb 0 ${kernel_addr_r} Image`

2. You should load the binary tree binary into the RAM. You can run this command in u-boot:

    `fatload usb 0 ${fdt_addr_r} bcm2837-rpi-3-b-plus.dtb`
1. We need to specify the bootargs. You can run:


    `setenv bootargs "8250.nr_uarts=1 root=/dev/sda2 rw rootwait console=ttyS0,115200n8"`


    `8250.nr_uarts=1` specifies the number of serial ports supported. In our case, it's one serial port `ttyS0`.


    `root=/dev/sda2` specify the partition of the root filesystem.


    `rootwait` Wait (indefinitely) for the root device to show up. Useful for devices that are detected asynchronously (e.g. USB and MMC devices).


    `console=ttyS0,115200n8` tells the kernel to start a console for us on the serial port `ttyS0` with the baudrate of 115200 with no parity and the data size is 8 bytes.


1. Now, we're ready to boot our kernel using the command:


    `booti ${kernel_addr_r} - ${fdt_addr_r}`


 <p align='center'>
   <img width="95%" src="./images/panic_noinit.png"/>
   </p>


If you got something like that, then you booted the kernel successfully. The last message indicates that there's no init file, which should exist in the root filesystem at /sbin/init. In the next section, we'll make it using `busybox`.

## 8- Build the filesystem

We'll use <a href="https://busybox.net/">busybox</a> to build the root filesystem. 

1. Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/mirror/busybox`

1. We don't need a default configuration, so we'll skip this step.

1. We can start configuring using this command:

    `make menuconfig`

    - Make a static binary (no shared libs). We can find that option under 

    `settings->Build Static Binary`

    - Determine the cross compiler. You can find it under this option:

    `settings->Cross compiler prefix`


1. Build the busybox using this command:

    `make -j12`

1. Install the filesystem using this command:

    `make install`

    The installed filesystem could be found in `./_install` folder. Copy it to the filesystem partition.

1. Make the `rcS` script that will remount the filesystem as read/write and do other stuff.

    `mkdir _install/etc`

    `mkdir _install/etc/init.d`

    `vim _install/etc/inittab`
    copy this and paste it in the `inittab` file
    
    ```
    ::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
    console::askfirst:/bin/sh
    ::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot

    ```
    
    `vim _install/etc/init.d/rcS`

    copy this and paste it in the `rcS` file
    
    ```
    #!/bin/sh

    mount -t devtmpfs null /dev
    mount -t sysfs null /sys
    mount -t proc null /proc
    mount -t vfat /dev/sda2 /boot/

    ```

    Make it excutable

    `chmod +x _install/etc/init.d/rcS`

1. Create important folders:
    
    `mkdir _install/proc`

    `mkdir _install/sys`
    
    `mkdir _install/dev`
    
    `mkdir _install/boot`

1. Copy _install to the root filesystem partition

    `cp -r _install/* /media/awadin/rootfs`


Plug in the USB drive into the raspberry pi and start the kernel by doing step #7 once more.
